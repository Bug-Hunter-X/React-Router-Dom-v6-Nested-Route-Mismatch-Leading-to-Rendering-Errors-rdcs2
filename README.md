This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Router Dom v6 involving nested routes. Incorrectly defining nested route paths can lead to unexpected rendering behavior. The `IncorrectNestedRoutes.js` file shows an example of this problem, where the nested route path is incorrectly defined, causing the child component to not render correctly. The `CorrectNestedRoutes.js` file demonstrates the correct way to define nested routes, resolving the rendering issues.  The solution involves carefully considering the parent route path when defining child route paths to ensure accurate path matching and correct component rendering.
