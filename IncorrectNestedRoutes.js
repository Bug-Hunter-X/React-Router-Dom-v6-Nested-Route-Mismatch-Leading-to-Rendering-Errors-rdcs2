In React Router Dom v6, a common issue arises when nested routes are not correctly defined or when there's a mismatch between the route paths and the component hierarchy. This can lead to unexpected rendering behavior, where components don't appear as expected or incorrect components are displayed.  For example, if a parent route has a path '/users' and a child route has a path '/profile', the full path for the child will be '/users/profile'. Incorrectly defining the child route path without considering the parent path will lead to rendering errors.

```javascript
//Incorrect nesting
<Route path='/users'>
  <Route path='/profile' element={<UserProfile/>}/>
</Route>

//Correct Nesting
<Route path='/users'>
  <Route path='profile' element={<UserProfile/>}/>
</Route>
```
